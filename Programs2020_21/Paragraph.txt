Just exactly like Father if Father had known as much about it the night before I went out there as he did the day after I came back thinking Mad impotent old man who realized at last that there must be some limit even to the capabilities of a demon for doing harm, who must have seen his situation as that of the show girl, the pony, who realizes that the principal tune she prances to comes not from horn and fiddle and drum but from a clock and calendar, must have seen himself as the old wornout cannon which realizes that it can deliver just one more fierce shot and crumble to dust in its own furious blast and recoil, who looked about upon the scene which was still within his scope and compass and saw son gone, vanished, more insuperable to him now than if the son were dead since now (if the son still lived) his name would be different and those to call him by it strangers and whatever dragon’s outcropping of Sutpen blood the son might sow on the body of whatever strange woman would therefore carry on the tradition, accomplish the hereditary evil and harm under another name and upon and among people who will never have heard the right one; daughter doomed to spinsterhood who had chosen spinsterhood already before there was anyone named Charles Bon since the aunt who came to succor her in bereavement and sorrow found neither but instead that calm absolutely impenetrable face between a homespun dress and sunbonnet seen before a closed door and again in a cloudy swirl of chickens while Jones was building the coffin and which she wore during the next year while the aunt lived there and the three women wove their own garments and raised their own food and cut the wood they cooked it with (excusing what help they had from Jones who lived with his granddaughter in the abandoned fishing camp with its collapsing roof and rotting porch against which the rusty scythe which Sutpen was to lend him, make him borrow to cut away the weeds from the door-and at last forced him to use though not to cut weeds, at least not vegetable weeds -would lean for two years) and wore still after the aunt’s indignation had swept her back to town to live on stolen garden truck and out o f anonymous baskets left on her front steps at night, the three of them, the two daughters negro and white and the aunt twelve miles away watching from her distance as the two daughters watched from theirs the old demon, the ancient varicose and despairing Faustus fling his final main now with the Creditor’s hand already on his shoulder, running his little country store now for his bread and meat, haggling tediously over nickels and dimes with rapacious and poverty-stricken whites and negroes, who at one time could have galloped for ten miles in any direction without crossing his own boundary, using out of his meagre stock the cheap ribbons and beads and the stale violently-colored candy with which even an old man can seduce a fifteen-year-old country girl, to ruin the granddaughter o f his partner, this Jones-this gangling malaria-ridden white man whom he had given permission fourteen years ago to squat in the abandoned fishing camp with the year-old grandchild-Jones, partner porter and clerk who at the demon’s command removed with his own hand (and maybe delivered too) from the showcase the candy beads and ribbons, measured the very cloth from which Judith (who had not been bereaved and did not mourn) helped the granddaughter to fashion a dress to walk past the lounging men in, the side-looking and the tongues, until her increasing belly taught her embarrassment-or perhaps fear;-Jones who before ’61 had not even been allowed to approach the front of the house and who during the next four years got no nearer than the kitchen door and that only when he brought the game and fish and vegetables on which the seducer-to-be’s wife and daughter (and Clytie too, the one remaining servant, negro, the one who would forbid him to pass the kitchen door with what he brought) depended on to keep life in them, but who now entered the house itself on the (quite frequent now) afternoons when the demon would suddenly curse the store empty of customers and lock the door and repair to the rear and in the same tone in which he used to address his orderly or even his house servants when he had them (and in which he doubtless ordered Jones to fetch from the showcase the ribbons and beads and candy) direct Jones to fetch the jug, the two of them (and Jones even sitting now who in the old days, the old dead Sunday afternoons of monotonous peace which they spent beneath the scuppernong arbor in the back yard, the demon lying in the hammock while Jones squatted against a post, rising from time to time to pour for the demon from the demijohn and the bucket of spring water which he had fetched from the spring more than a mile away then squatting again, chortling and chuckling and saying `Sho, Mister Tawm’ each time the demon paused)-the two of them drinking turn and turn about from the jug and the demon not lying down now nor even sitting but reaching after the third or second drink that old man’s state of impotent and furious undefeat in which he would rise, swaying and plunging and shouting for his horse and pistols to ride single-handed into Washington and shoot Lincoln (a year or so too late here) and Sherman both, shouting, ‘Kill them! Shoot them down like the dogs they are!’ and Jones: ‘Sho, Kernel; sho now’ and catching him as he fell and commandeering the first passing wagon to take him to the house and carry him up the front steps and through the paintless formal door beneath its fanlight imported pane by pane from Europe which Judith held open for him to enter with no change, no alteration in that calm frozen face which she had worn for four years now, and on up the stairs and into the bedroom and put him to bed like a baby and then lie down himself on the floor beside the bed though not to sleep since before dawn the man on the bed would stir and groan and Jones would say, ‘flyer I am, Kernel. Hit’s all right. They aint whupped us yit, air they?’ this Jones who after the demon rode away with the regiment when the granddaughter was only eight years old would tell people that he ‘was lookin after Major’s place and niggers’ even before they had time to ask him why he was not with the troops and perhaps in time came to believe the lie himself, who was among the first to greet the demon when he returned, to meet him at the gate and say, ‘Well, Kernel, they kilt us but they aint whupped us yit, air they?’ who even worked, labored, sweat at the demon’s behest during that first furious period while the demon believed he could restore by sheer indomitable willing the Sutpen’s Hundred which he remembered and had lost, labored with no hope of pay or reward who must have seen long before the demon did (or would admit it) that the task was hopeless-blind Jones who apparently saw still in that furious lecherous wreck the old fine figure of the man who once galloped on the black thoroughbred about that domain two boundaries of which the eye could not see from any point.When the upper limb of the sun disappears below the horizon the brilliance of Mother Nature becomes apparent. On my left across the lake low-lying hills crawl upward across the horizon. In front of me covered by a few trees, is a lone secluded island. It looks as if it were a boat, attempting to escape to tranquil waters. On my right the hills gradually turn to mountains. A tall and slender Lodge Pole Pine minutely conceals them. Her finger-like branches delicately reach down toward the lake, trying to touch her own reflection. High above me, moisture laden clouds span out over the mountain tops, resembling a magenta colored quilt. In front of me, a broadening division in the clouds crests with a final effort to avoid succumbing to the shroud of night. The ever present island balances upon the waters, reflecting a perfect vision of it's unblemished counterpart. It is a mirrored understatement of nature's true beauty.As a child at the age of two, my sister and I had pictures taken together. My sister and I are ten months and three weeks apart. In this special family picture was look identical. Our big, dark blue and brown eyes and smile resemble two calm little girls, enjoying the moment with peaceful smiles on our faces. In our long, dark red and blue dresses we sit straight up in front of a warn red fireplace surrounded by green plants. Our dark brown, wavy hair even matched. We both had baby pink bows off to the side of our heads that resemble a blooming flower. Growing up our family consisted of our father, my sister, and I. My sister and I have both been there for each other through “the thick and the thin.” My photograph pf my sister and reveals how close we are in age and through this paragraph it also reveals how close we are when it comes to love and friendship.The old car slowly chugged down the street like the caboose of a steam engine train. The car goes up the hill it goes Ka boom , kachunk. The car is old and weathered with rust covering the entire body like cancer consuming its victim. Wheels and tires wobble like a drunk bum on his way home from the bar. Hub caps are gone along with all the mirrors and extras on the car. Black smoke flows out the rotten tail pips like the smoke out of and old cobb pipe. The local junk yard had seen better cars then this. The interior was a dusty brown with holes covering almost every square inch of the seat covers. The ceiling was hanging down and the rust had eaten through the roof like a Billy goat through a tin can. This old car is my old car and it is as faithful as a good old dog by always starting and getting me from were I need to go.A beach in Hawaii on a December day is like a day at a lake in mid August. The beach smells fresh, almost like a new ocean breeze air freshener. The sand is hot and looks like gold blended in with little white specks; it sparkles like the water running off the swimmers back and feels like walking on coals from a burning grill. Not far from the shore, you can see the coral sitting still in the wild and shallow water. Trutles drift in to see all the people. The plam trees sway in the air from the forceful wind. In a distance, a house is beutifully placed right by the water, so it can look across the ocean each and every day. People are laughing and playing in the burning sand, and others are relaxing on the beach bronzing their skin while enjoying the bright rays of light coming from the sun. From a far distance the ocean is a deep navy blue; waves come in like a bulldozer from all the wind. At night everything is still. Waves are still coming in but not as hard, while the beach is cleared from all the people. All you can hear is the waves of the ocean and the light breeze coming from the giant palm trees. The beach is a spectacular place. Leaving it is excruciating and difficult to do.My wife and I honeymooned in Playa Del Carmen, Mexico; while there, we visited the ruins of Tulum. At the entrance of the ruins, large palm frond trees stand lush and tall with wild life resting on its branches. In the middle of this miniature rain forest is a dirt path leading towards a hand built stone wall ten feet tall. While walking through the passage built in the wall, on the right, at the top of the wall sat a large, brown and green hued iguana. Just past this great wall of protection is a field of green grass overlooking the ruin's. To the left is a small court yard bordered by a stone wall leading to the agua blue, warm ocean a few hundred yards away. In a corner section of this cramped courtyard, is a fresh water hole in a cave like crevice. As you walk the acres upon acres of grass, the sounds of chirping and squawking birds permeate the air. Vibrant colored plants and iguanas of all sizes give you an idea of life as it was two thousand years ago. Enormous square and rectangular stones capture the eye for the beauty they hold both outside and the history made inside. Steep staircases rise from the ground to ascend to the top of these world treasures; in fact, a few of these temples were built atop the cliffs of the Yucatan Peninsula. The beach below is blinding white, soft coral sand, crushed to a fine powder by swift ocean currents.My eight year old son, Joshua, stands out in a crowd of children because of his distinctive appearance and gentle manner. The first thing I notice when I look at him is his size. He stands at shoulder height next to me; indeed, he is a head taller than other children his age, and is definitely stronger. His weight is a hefty 113 pounds; without a doubt, he weighs forty pounds more than other children in his grade level. Recently, my husband signed him up for flag football, where he was told: “It is a good thing the children aren’t playing tackle football, because he might inadvertently hurt the other kids.” Also remarkable is his red hair; it is thick, coarse to touch, and styled in an old-fashioned boy cut. Hardly a person can pass Joshua without rubbing his head for good luck, and saying “Where’d ya get that hair?” Joshua’s chubby face is fair, with freckles lightly dotting his exceptionally boyish features. His eyes are pale blue, and his eyebrows blond; in fact, white, in contrast with his red hair. His lips are full and somewhat feminine, and his newly-grown permanent teeth, which appear large alongside his remaining baby teeth, have a wide gap. His shoulders are broad, his chest juts out, and his belly is plump. His forearms are bulky, and will someday be powerful, yet his wrists retain the same creases he has had since he was a ten pound newborn. When we hold hands, his hands feel nearly as large as mine, and are unexpectedly soft. His legs are sturdy and strong, and his knees are covered with fresh scrapes and purple bruises, received while skateboarding and biking. His ankles are also solid; consequently, he can’t wear boots. His feet are size 6 and wide; therefore, too wide for slip-on tennis shoes. Despite his appearance, Joshua is unexpectedly sensitive and caring; in fact, he still likes to sit on my lap, an awkward feat for me. He likes to open doors for me, tend his little brother, and help me grocery shop. From head to toe he is a contradiction; although he is only eight years old, he is big and strong, while loving and gentle, and that makes him stand out from other children, at least in my eyes.In front of me on the table sat a beautiful pure white bowl, simplistic in design, hiding a decadent surprise inside. In the bowl was hidden something that was not so pure, however, the irresistible indulgence was worth every calorie that I knew it contained. As I looked inside I saw on the bottom of the bowl a hot, tender brownie loaded with macadamia nuts. I knew from past experience that the nuts had a creamy and smooth texture, almost like white chocolate. On top of the brownie were two firmly packed scoops of ice cream, laying side by side, each one a different flavor. The scoop on the right was a rich vanilla, flecked with dark specks of vanilla bean. The scoop on the left was a dark, smooth, bittersweet chocolate. The scoops were just starting to melt tiny rivers of melted cream down the sides of the hot brownie, pooling on the bottom of the pure white bowl. These scoops of ice cream were draped with a sumptuous, rich, hot fudge sauce. Topping the luscious sauce was an ample dollop of whipped cream that was in perfect contrast to the dense, almost too rich dessert below. The whipped cream was topped with a shower of chocolate sprinkles and finely chopped walnuts. What finally completed this wonderful creation was a perfect maraschino cherry, its red juice sending tiny streams down the whole mountain of dessert delight. The contrast of colors, textures and flavors in this dessert appealed to every part of my senses. I could not wait to eat it.The much advertised meteor show this summer was a memory ot behold. The air was crisp and cool. I did not even feel a hint of a breeze on my skin as I lie on my back in the darkness. The warm temperature of the water against the cooler air created a drifting airy fog that whispered over the lake. Darkness enveloped the sky as only a slight curve of the moon shone in the night; consequently, this made the perfect stage for the breathtaking view of twinkling stars. In the still of the night many galaxies glittered from the depths of the sky as I felt hypnotically drawn into the mesmorizing show above me. Broad irregular bands of light from the Milky Way stretched across the sky while the big and little dipper shined brightly. As predicted, the meteor show began with various sized meteors cascading to the earth's atmosphere about every fifteen to thirty seconds. Shots of light, followed by orange and white mist, describes the presence of the meteors. The panoramic view made it possible to witness several meteors at a time while marveling at each one. An event like this may only happen once in a lifetime, so I will cherish this moment and it will remain as one of my fondest memories.As Chad Reed pulled into the pits, you could tell just by looking at him that this had been a grueling race. His dirt bike was plastered with so much brown, wet, sticky mud that you couldn’t even read the number plates. His boots, resting comfortably on the foot pegs, were a mess of muddy brown dirt, bright white plastic and black buckles. His riding pants were soaked and covered with mud on the front, while the back remained a brilliant white and blue. His chest protector seemed to have kept most of the mud off of his blue and white jersey, although his sleeves had turned the same swampy brown color as his bike. His goggles hung looped over the handlebars of his bike, dripping the ooze it had saved from Chad’s eyes. His helmet, still on his head, was a greasy smeary brown, save for the thin line of white and blue where his goggle strap had been. Although his body looked beaten, his eyes, peering through the helmet, seemed relaxed and happy. He had just won a very long and very tiring race.Back in 1999 this fearless athlete posed in this football picture. In the far distance below the cloudless sky stands an off-white stadium. Embedded in the center is large, cracked, blue, painted, letters that spell out BISON. Beneath the old stadium are rows of worn-out bleachers which are completely empty. Up in front stands the competitor down on one knee. As you observe more, the sport player is wearing a blue Bison jersey sporting the number 60. To the left above the freshly trimmed green grass that engulfs this player’s figure lays a football. In the center of the picture, you see her pale white face and dark brown eyes. Around these features you can not help but notice the bronzed hair; which appears to be pulled back around this slender face. Her stern look shows how proud she is; nonetheless, all the confidence she carries on her padded up shoulders. This unique woman is not only elegant and brave; she is my sister, Margaret Eva Hoyt.
